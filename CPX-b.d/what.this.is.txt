CPX-b - second Circuit Playground Express box (hence, -b).

The plan is to treat the CPX as a 14-pin device (arranged
as with DIP-14) in terms of wiring to it (with a few n/c
which work nicely as mechanical mount points for the
CPX target board).

Notably, Pins 7 and 14 are arranged as Ground and Vcc 3.3V,
respectively, to match DIP-14 conventions.
