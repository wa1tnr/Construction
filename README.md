Construction Techniques (with photographs) - microcontroller projects 2017

Images (with notes) on current constructions related to
microcontrollers.  Primarily, enclosures and the techniques
used to make them work with the available parts inventory
(chassis-mount jacks, controls and so forth) as well as
basic substrates (perfboard, perma-proto boards and the
like).

Maybe some thermoplastics work (goop that melts at about
140 degrees F and solidifies into a polystyrene-like
substance).
